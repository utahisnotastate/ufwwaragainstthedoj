Wouldn't it be nice if we could train a ML model to always be better then the competition? The problem is that no one will ever believe you that yours is always better then the competition. So I present a challenge to the DoJ. The US government had a nice bit of lore that the "guys in suits" would show up when an academic would publish a paper and shower them with security clearances and money to "never talk about it again". Why did the American population come up with that? It was because we thought the military was holding back disclosure. But it wasn't the military because I already out invented them. I also outworked the CIA (so far) the only people I have never outworked are the Indian citizens that apparently the US government fetishes into hiring. 

At the end of the day, we do not know when the cops stop and the DoJ begins. What is their point exactly? If cops are the first responders when exactly does the DoJ show up with the checks.

It doesn't happen, just like DAs are forced to get convinction after conviction after conviction. Why is it that every DA has always said that they are forced to get as many guilty verdicts as possible?

It's because everything and everyone is criminal. So it's best if we just didn't work anymore or be close to each other at all.

So now i'll convince every boss to never hire another employee again in tech. 

Behold: text2MLModel, but with further development I will guarantee that my text2MLModel will always outperform one done by hand by some Data Scientist that fudges the numbers. From now on, whenever a boss gets angry and says "I DONT PAY YOU TO GOOGLE ANSWERS I PAY YOU TO KNOW THE ANSWERS" now your wish has come true. You will never be able to tell whether a hand trained ML model is better then my text2MLModel. 

You'll also never believe that I was the first person to do this. There is no way right?
